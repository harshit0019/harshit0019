# Harshit Yadav — Data Analyst · Developer · Power BI Enthusiast 👋

I turn messy data into clear decisions and build interactive tools that make insights actionable. I blend data analysis, programming, and Power BI to create end-to-end analytics — from ETL and modeling to dashboards and deployable apps.

🧭 How I approach a problem
1. Source & understand the data — ask the right questions.  
2. Clean & transform — reliable pipelines (pandas / Power Query / ETL scripts).  
3. Model & analyze — statistical summaries, features, lightweight ML.  
4. Visualize & explain — Power BI reports, Streamlit dashboards, Plotly figures.  
5. Deploy & automate — scheduled refreshes, simple apps, and reproducible scripts.

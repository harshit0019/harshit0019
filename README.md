# Harshit Yadav — Data Alchemist 🧪 · Developer 💻 · Power BI Architect 📊

I turn raw numbers into stories that people understand and act on. I love crafting clean data flows, expressive visualizations, and lightweight apps that let stakeholders explore insights themselves. Think of me as someone who builds the bridge between data and decisions — with code, models, and elegant dashboards.

---

🧱 The "Objects" I work with
- Object: Data (📦)
  - Raw logs, CSVs, SQL tables, Excel spreadsheets
  - Operations: ingestion, validation, normalization, enrichment
- Object: Pipeline (🔁)
  - Tools: pandas, Power Query, custom ETL scripts
  - Outcome: reproducible, incremental data refreshes
- Object: Model (🧠)
  - Analytics: aggregation, segmentation, basic predictive models
  - Deliverables: features, KPI definitions, confidence notes
- Object: Dashboard (🖼️)
  - Platforms: Power BI (DAX & Data Model), Streamlit
  - UX: stories, drill-throughs, bookmarks, and guided navigations
- Object: App (⚙️)
  - Lightweight web apps or scripts for automation, monitoring, or demos

🎨 A more creative snapshot — who I am
- Role: Data Analyst · Analytics Engineer · Dashboard Designer  
- Languages: Python, TypeScript  
- Passion: turning ambiguity into metrics, and metrics into memorable visuals  
- Favorite tasks: cleaning a tangled dataset, writing a crisp DAX measure, shipping an interactive report

---

🔭 How I typically craft a solution (play-by-play)
1. Exploration object — quick EDA to map the shape of the data (pandas / SQL).  
2. Sanitation object — fix types, missing values, and outliers; create safe pipelines.  
3. Model object — compute measures, aggregations, and lightweight predictions.  
4. Presentation object — design the dashboard story; prototype in Streamlit or Power BI.  
5. Delivery object — document assumptions, add scheduled refresh notes, and hand off.

---

🧰 Toolbelt (condensed)
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Data Modeling), Streamlit, Plotly / Matplotlib, SQL, TypeScript, React, Git, Excel

---

✨ What I deliver for teams
- Reusable ETL snippets and documented notebooks  
- Scalable Power BI models with clear relationship diagrams  
- DAX-first KPI definitions that stakeholders can trust  
- Lightweight demos for stakeholder sign-off (Streamlit or static GIFs)  
- Automated refresh playbook and deployment notes

---

📦 Sample objects I can add to any repo (examples)
- "data_pipeline.py" — reusable ingestion + cleaning functions  
- "report_notes.md" — DAX snippets and KPI logic explained in plain English  
- "demo.gif" — 10–20s walkthrough of key dashboard interactions  
- "requirements.txt" + launch instructions for Streamlit demos

---

🔍 Accessibility & storytelling
I design visuals that are read-first: titles, contextual subtitles, and a clear call-to-action. Colors and interactions prioritize clarity, accessibility, and stakeholder-focused workflows.

---

🛠 How to run my Python / Streamlit objects (quick)
1. python -m venv .venv  
2. source .venv/bin/activate  (macOS / Linux) or .venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)  
3. pip install -r requirements.txt  
4. streamlit run app.py  (for demos)

For Power BI artifacts, I include model notes and recommended refresh settings in the repo's README.

📫 Let’s collaborate
- GitHub: https://github.com/harshit0019  
- Open to mentoring, collaborating on dashboards, or helping convert analyses into production-ready reports.  
- Want GIFs, DAX snippets, or a branch with this README added? Pick one and I’ll prepare it next.

Thanks for stopping by — explore the repos for hands-on examples of pipelines, notebooks, and dashboards.
